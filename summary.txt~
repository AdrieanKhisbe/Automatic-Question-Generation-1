The other thing that's really important about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain, but is to some extent a network property, and if we flip the brain on its back, I love this little bit of spinal cord here, this bit here is the hypothalamus, and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures, not least the biological clock.
